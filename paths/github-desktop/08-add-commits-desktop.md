  ## Making great commits

  When you work on GitHub.com, a commit can only include the changes you made to a single file. But, when you work in the desktop app, you have a lot more control over your commits.

  With GitHub Desktop, a commit can include multiple files, or you can pick a specific change within a file you would like to commit.

  When you assemble the changes you have made, you should try to create what we like to call an **atomic commit**. In other words, each commit you make should contain changes that belong together and represent a discrete unit of work.
