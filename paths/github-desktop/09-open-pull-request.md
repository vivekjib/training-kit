  ## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

  Let's review where we are in the GitHub Flow:

  1. Create a branch
  1. Add commits
  1. **Open a Pull Request** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  1. Collaborate, and make more commits
  1. Merge the Pull Request

  Simply click the "Update Origin" button. This sends your branch up to GitHub. Then, you open the Pull Request there!
