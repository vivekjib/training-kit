  ## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

  Remember, the 5 steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) are:

  1. **Create a branch** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  2. **Make commits** :arrow_left: _(And this one.)_
  3. Open a Pull Request
  4. Collaborate, and make more commits
  5. Merge the Pull Request

  Hopefully this looks familiar since you've followed this workflow (at least) twice. Now you will follow it once more to add your page to our directory.
