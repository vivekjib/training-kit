  ## What is GitHub?

  We are glad you asked! Many people stumble onto GitHub through one of the millions of Open Source projects it holds or because their employer or professor is using it. Why do these projects use GitHub?

  **At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.**

  People around the world use GitHub to collaborate on projects ranging from software to policy documents and cookbooks. You can share your projects with the world and invite your friends to help, or you can keep your projects private and still have easy access wherever you are.

  **GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.**

  While you are collaborating, GitHub uses Git (open source, distributed version control software) to keep track of every change made to your project.

  **GitHub is so much more.**

  GitHub is used to build some of the most powerful applications in the world. It can do a lot of really cool things, but this class is going to focus on getting you started with the basics. We will dig in to the rest later!
