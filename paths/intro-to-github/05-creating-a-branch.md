  ## Creating A Branch

  You just learned that the first step in the GitHub Workflow is to create a branch.

  Branches are an important part of the GitHub workflow because they allow us to separate our work from the `master` branch. In other words, everyone's pins that are already shown on the map will be safe while you learn how to add yours.

  Since branches are so important, we recommend you take a look at this video to learn more:

  ## Tips for Using Branches

  A single project like ours can have hundreds of branches - all trying out new features or alternate approaches to the same feature.

  The trick in managing branches with a team is to keep them concise and short lived. In other words, a single branch should represent a single new feature or bug fix. And, while GitHub doesn't limit the number of branches you can have, it makes things a lot less confusing when you only keep them active for a few days and delete them after they have been merged (we will discuss merging a little later).
