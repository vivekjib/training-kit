  ## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

  Now you will see all of the great pages that have been made by others, and share your page with the world in our class repository! To do that, we'll follow the same 5 steps of the GitHub workflow, but on the [class repository](https://github.com/githubschool/open-enrollment-classes-introduction-to-github).

  Remember, the 5 steps are:

  1. **Create a branch** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  2. **Make commits** :arrow_left: _(And this one.)_
  3. Open a Pull Request
  4. Collaborate, and make more commits
  5. Merge the Pull Request

  You've followed this workflow twice so far; once in the [Introduction to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) course, and once in this course.
