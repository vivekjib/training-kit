## Remote vs. Local Repositories

Let's take a moment to define a couple of important terms:

A **remote** repository is the copy of your project that is housed on GitHub.com. You access this copy through a unique URL.

A **local** repository is a copy of the remote repository that you have "cloned" to your computer. This copy includes all of the files, history, and branches in your project.

In this class, you will make changes to this local repository and then sync them with the copy of your project on GitHub.com.
