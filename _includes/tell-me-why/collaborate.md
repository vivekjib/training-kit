## Understanding Continuous Integration

Our class repository uses continuous integration (CI) to ensure that the files being added conform to certain guidelines. For example, our tests are checking to ensure you have formatted the file correctly and placed it in the correct directory within the repository.

If the tests do not pass on your Pull Request, you will be unable to merge until you have fixed the problem. For help, see the **Help me troubleshoot** section above.
