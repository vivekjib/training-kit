## Commit --amend

The `commit --amend` command enables you to modify the message and contents of the _last_ commit you made.

This can be helpful if you identify a spelling error or grammatical issue with the commit message you created or if you forgot to add some of the changes in the working directory.

### How commit --amend Works

`git commit --amend` will combine the changes in your staging area with the changes in the _last_ commit you made. Your text editor will also open, allowing you to edit the commit message.
