## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

Remember, we used the GitHub Flow in [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/), and we use it again here! :smile:

The main steps of the GitHub workflow are:

1. **Create a branch** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
1. Add commits
1. Open a Pull Request
1. Collaborate, and make more commits
1. Merge the Pull Request

You learned how to create a branch in the Introduction course, too. But this time, we will do it in the local repository.

When you create a local branch, it will persist regardless of how you decide to work with your files.

Feel free to use your favorite text editor or IDE to work with your files. Rest assured that you will only be making changes on the branch you have selected.
