## Reviewing the GitHub Flow

We are following the 5 steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which are:

1. :white_check_mark: Create a branch
2. :white_check_mark: Add commits
3. **Open a Pull Request** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
4. Collaborate, and make more commits
5. Merge the Pull Request
