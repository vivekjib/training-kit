## Using GitHub Issues

GitHub _Issues_ are used to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

- Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team (even your future team member) has the complete story.
- Allowing you to cross-link to other _Issues_ and _Pull requests_.
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.

## Why Did We Ask You to Create an _Issue_?

When you sign up for GitHub, you automatically have **Read only access** to any public repository. This means you can look around, comment on _Issues_ and _Pull Requests_, and open new _Issues_ to report bugs or request features on your favorite projects. You can also create repositories on your own account!

However, you can not make changes directly on someone else's project unless you use a special workflow (called "Fork" and "Pull") or they give you **collaborator access**.

For this repository, we have created a webhook that adds you as a collaborator when you create an _Issue_. If you completed the steps above, you are ready to be a collaborator on our project!
