## Your First Website

For this activity, we are focusing on the steps for working with a repository with GitHub.com and your local environment. If you are not familiar with web design, that's ok. These instructions will create a very basic, unformatted page.

There are several tools you can use in combination with GitHub Pages to create a beautiful website. For example, you can download one of the themes on [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/) or you can create a regular HTML page. The possibilities are endless!
