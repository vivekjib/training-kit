The GitHub repository is the container that holds everything related to your project.

### Repository Tabs

- **Code**: The code view is where you will find the files included in the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentation, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files will be tracked via Git version control.

- **README.md**: The README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. The README should explain the project and point readers to helpful information within the project.

- **Issues:** Issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and are designed to encourage discussion and collaboration.

- **Pull Requests**:A Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests are used to resolve Issues.
