Visit your pull request now that it's ready to be merged:

- You can merge a pull request at the bottom of the conversation view.
- You simply click the Merge pull request button.
- Now we want to include some special text that tells GitHub that this pull request should close the original issue.
- Fixes is one of the special keywords that GitHub looks for in merge commits.
- We can use the # to auto-generate the link to the issue.
- Since the issue title contained your username, you can type the first few letters of your GitHub username to narrow down the list of possible issues.
- Simply select your issue from the list.
- And click confirm merge.
- A confirmation message will let you know that your pull request was merged and closed. It also let's you know that the branch we created can be safely deleted.
- Since we won't be using this branch anymore, you should go ahead and delete it now.

You can now go back to the issues tab and you will see that your issue has been closed. Congratulations, you have completed your first contribution on GitHub.
