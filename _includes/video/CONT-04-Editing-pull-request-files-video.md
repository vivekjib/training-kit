Since you created the pull request, you will be notified when someone adds a comment. In this case, the comment tells us we need to make a change to the file we have already created. Let's see how GitHub makes this easy.

### Making edits

Let's go back to your pull request and make the edits requested by your collaborators:

- Take a look at the change requested and then go to the files changed view.
- Click the pencil icon to access the file editor.
- Make the requested changes.
- The commit message should describe what was changed in the present tense. For example, Add favorite color.
- Since we accessed our file through the pull request, GitHub helpfully directs us to commit our changes to the same branch.
- And then click commit changes.

If you want to see what was changed in a specific commit, you can go to the Commits tab and click on the Commit ID. Go ahead and check your own pull request now to see if you need to make any changes.
