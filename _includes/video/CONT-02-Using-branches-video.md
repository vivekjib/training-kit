Every day you will be editing files on your project or adding new files. You don't want to take risks with the code on your master branch so you need to create a branch.

When you create a branch, you are essentially creating an identical copy of the project at that point in time that is completely separate from the master branch. This keeps your the code on your master branch safe while you experiment and fix issues.

Let's learn how you can create a new branch.

Earlier you created an issue to create an introduction file. Let's create a branch that you will use to add your file:

- You can create a branch by clicking on the branch dropdown.
- And entering a `branch name` in the text field.
- When you press `Enter`, you are automatically switched to your branch. Now, any changes you make to the files in the repository will be applied to this new branch.

However, a word of caution. When you leave the repository and come back, notice that GitHub automatically assumes you want to see the items on the master branch. If you want to continue working on your branch, you will need to reselect it using the branch dropdown. Now you are ready to create your own branch and start adding some commits.
