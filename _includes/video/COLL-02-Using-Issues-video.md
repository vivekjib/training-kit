Let's dive a little deeper into Issues.

Here, I will create an issue titled Class Goals. Let's look at some of the special features in issues that you will use to collaborate with your team.

GitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.

One of our favorite features is the @mention. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.

You can use the preview tab to see how your comment will be rendered (meaning how GitHub will actually display your Markdown file).

You can also add pictures by simply dragging and dropping them into the comment field, or clicking the file uploader link.

Click the green comment button to add your comments to the discussion.

As you can imagine, a large project can have hundreds of issues. Let's look at a few ways your project team can organize issues.

First, you can assign issues to anyone with access to the repo. Typically, this will be the person who is currently responsible for the next step in the life of the issue. The issue assignee may change over time.

You can also use labels to help you organize issues. GitHub comes with a number of built-in labels, but you can always delete those or add your own. As a project grows in size, using assignees and labels makes it much easier to find a specific issue.

Filters allow you to easily search for Issues by creator, labels, assignees and more. We will continue to explore these features throughout the course. For now, let's practice creating an issue!
