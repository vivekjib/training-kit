Now that you are a collaborator, use the local workflow we just learned to make changes to this repository. This exercise is a bit of a review, but if you need assistance with any of the required steps, more detailed directions are available in 'I need a refresher' below! Good luck!

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Create a new branch in the cloned repository. Something like `yourUsername-add-page` is a perfect branch name.
1. Checkout to your new branch.
1. Create a file in the `_pages` directory titled: `username.yaml`. Replace `username` with your GitHub username.
1. Enter the following content into your file:

        ---

        pageUrl: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
