Now that you have made some local commits, it is time to send your changes to the remote copy of your repository on GitHub.com and create a Pull Request:

1. Type `git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME` to push your commits to the remote, and set a tracking branch.
1. Enter your GitHub username and password, if prompted to do so.
1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub.
1. Fill out the body of the Pull Request with information about the changes you're introducing.
