# Activity: Create a New Page

Time to add our work history as a page to our Jekyll site.

1. Create a new branch off the ```gh-pages``` branch named ```work-history```.
2. In the ```_pages``` folder, create a **new** file named ```work-history.md```.
3. Add your work history to the file and click ```Commit```. If you'd like, you can copy and paste the work history we provided earlier in the course.
4. Create a **pull request** selecting ```gh-pages``` as the **base** and ```work-history``` as the **compare**.
5. Merge the **pull request**.
6. Navigate to your website to see the changes you just made.
