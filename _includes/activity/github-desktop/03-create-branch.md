Now that you have a local copy of the repository, let's use the steps of [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make a change in your project. First we will create a branch:

1. Within GitHub Desktop, click "File", then click "New Branch".
1. In the `Name` field, type a meaningful name for your branch. Something like `add-index-page` will work nicely.
1. If you have been following the directions exactly, GitHub Desktop knows to create the new branch based on `master` because it is the branch you were checked out to when you clicked the "New Branch" option.
1. GitHub Desktop will automatically create your new branch and switch you to it.
