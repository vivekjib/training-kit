After you have finished making your changes, it is time to commit them.

1. Click the **changes** tab in the left sidebar to see a list of the files that have been changed or added since the last commit.
1. Use the checkboxes to indicate which files should be part of the commit. In this activity, you'll select the `index.html` file.
*Note: It is a good idea to group files together based on the type of changes or the file content. For example, if you fixed the same formatting issue in several documents, you should group them into one commit.*
1. Type your commit message in the Summary field.
1. You will notice that GitHub Desktop has already populated the commit button with the current branch. Simply click the button to commit your changes.
