1. On the Options section (default information displayed), scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
1. Click **Choose a theme**.
1. Decide which theme you would like to use, and click **Select theme**.
1. Accept the filler text by scrolling to the bottom of the page and click on **Commit Changes**.
1. Your site is published at: `USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME`.
