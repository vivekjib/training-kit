## Merge Explained

When you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from the branch you created and adding it to the content and history of the `master` branch.

### Tips for Merging with Teams

Many project teams have established rules about who should (or shouldn't) merge a pull request:

- Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge.
- Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency.
- Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request.

This is a discussion you should have with the other members of your team. For today, you should only merge your own pull request.

## When to Merge

Most teams also have processes to help others know when it is OK to merge. At GitHub, we like to use emoji to indicate we have checked over the Pull Request and it looks good to merge. We like to use :+1:, :ship:, or :shipit: (`:+1:`, `:ship:`, and `:shipit:`).
